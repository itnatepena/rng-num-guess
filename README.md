# Numerical Password Guesser

The Numerical Password Guesser project is a demonstration of the vulnerabilities associated with using numerical passwords and serves as a visualization of how quickly computers can crack such codes. The project highlights my understanding of programming, cybersecurity principles, and my commitment to exploring relevant topics.

## Key Features:

- Developed in Python, the project allows users to input a numerical password between 0 and 999,999.
- Utilizing an efficient approach, the program guesses the inputted password within a remarkably short time frame of just 2 seconds.
- Trained the model to avoid guessing the same answer twice for improved machine/script efficiency.
- Through a visually engaging video demonstration, the project emphasizes the importance of using strong passwords and highlights the risks of relying solely on numerical passwords.

## Lessons Conveyed:

- The project underscores the importance of employing strong, alphanumeric passwords that include a mix of numbers, letters, and special characters.
- It serves as a reminder that relying solely on numerical passwords can leave individuals vulnerable to rapid password cracking attempts.

The Numerical Password Guesser project demonstrates my understanding of programming, cybersecurity principles, and my commitment to exploring relevant topics.
